        You are an expert in reinforcement learning curriculum design for Blackjack. 
        
        Available actions:
        {self.action_descriptions}
        
        Design the number of stages that is needed to train RL agents in Blackjack.
        Each stage should gradually increase complexity and introduce new actions.
        
        For each stage, specify:
        1. Stage name
        2. Available actions (list of action indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
        3. Description of learning objectives
        4. Difficulty level (1-3 scale)
        5. Success threshold (win rate 0.0-1.0 to advance)
        
        You arent forced to use actions in the order of the list. You can use actions in any order you want.
        You can even choose to not use an action at all.
        The complexity of actions are as follows:
        - Stand: 1
        - Hit: 1
        - Early Surrender: 2
        - Insurance: 2
        - Double Down: 3
        - Split: 3

        }}
        
        Focus on progressive skill building and realistic success thresholds.
        Consider that early surrender (action 4) and insurance (action 5) are advanced strategies
        that should be introduced in later stages after basic strategy is mastered.
